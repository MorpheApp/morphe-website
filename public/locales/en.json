    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about Morphe",
    "q1": "What apps can Morphe patch?",
    "a1": "You can patch any app you want. As long as you want YouTube or YouTube Music. We're constantly working on expanding support to more apps.",
    "q2": "Is Morphe safe?",
    "a2": "As safe as modifying obfuscated bytecode can be. All source code for Morphe is open source and free for anyone to inspect. Our community actively reviews and contributes to the codebase.",
    "q3": "Will Morphe brick my phone?",
    "a3": "Only if your phone decides to brick itself. Otherwise your device will be fine. Morphe only modifies app packages and doesn't touch system files.",
    "q4": "Can I customize apps to my preference?",

    "q5": "What's Morphe's privacy policy?",
    "a5-part1": "This website uses",
    "a5-part2": "for analytics: no cookies, no personal data, nothing sold, and nothing shared. Morphe does not add analytics or data collection to any patched apps.",
    "q6": "Why the name Morphe?",

    "a7": "No. But also yes. It's advanced bytecode manipulation that feels like magic.",
